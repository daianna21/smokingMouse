Welcome to the `smokingMouse` project! Here you’ll be able to access the
mouse expression data used for the analysis of the
smoking-nicotine-mouse LIBD project.

## Overview

This bulk RNA-sequencing project consisted of a differential expression
analysis (DEA) involving 4 data types: genes, transcripts, exons, and
exon-exon junctions. The main goal of this study was to explore the
effects of prenatal exposure to smoking and nicotine on the developing
mouse brain. As secondary objectives, this work evaluated: 1) the
affected genes by each exposure in the adult female brain in order to
compare offspring and adult results, and 2) the effects of smoking on
adult blood and brain to search for overlapping biomarkers in both
tissues. Finally, DEGs identified in mouse were compared against
previously published results in human (Semick et al., 2020 and Toikumo
et al., 2023).

## Study design

<figcaption style="color: gray; line-height: 0.88; text-align: justify">

<font size="-1.5"><b>Experimental design of the study</b>. <b>A)</b> 21
pregnant mice were split into two experiments: in the first one prenatal
nicotine exposure (PNE) was modeled administering nicotine (n=3) or
vehicle (n=3) to the dams during gestation, and in the second maternal
smoking during pregnancy (MSDP) was modeled exposing dams to cigarette
smoke during gestation (n=8) or using them as controls (n=7). A total of
137 pups were born: 19 were born to nicotine-administered mice, 23 to
vehicle-administered mice, 46 to smoking-exposed mice, and 49 to smoking
control mice. 17 nonpregnant adult females were also
nicotine-administered (n=9) or vehicle-administered (n=8) to model adult
nicotine exposure, and 9 additional nonpregnant dams were
smoking-exposed (n=4) or controls (n=5) to model adult smoking. Frontal
cortex samples of all P0 pups (n=137: 42 for PNE and 95 for MSDP) and
adults (n=47: 23 for the nicotine experiment and 24 for the smoking
experiment) were obtained, as well as blood samples from the
smoking-exposed and smoking control adults (n=24), totaling 208 samples.
Number of donors and samples are indicated in the figure. <b>B)</b> RNA
was extracted from such samples and bulk RNA-seq experiments were
performed, obtaining expression counts for genes, transcripts, exons,
and exon-exon junctions.

## Workflow

The next table summarizes the analyses done at each level.

<figcaption style="color: gray; line-height: 0.94; text-align: justify">

<font size="-1.5"><b> Summary of analysis steps across gene expression
feature levels</b>:

<b>1. Data processing</b>: counts of genes, exons, and exon-exon
junctions were normalized to CPM and log2-transformed; transcript
expression values were only log2-transformed since they were already in
TPM. Lowly-expressed features were removed using the indicated functions
and samples were separated by tissue and age in order to create subsets
of the data for downstream analyses.

<b>2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</b>: QC metrics of the samples
were examined and used to filter the poor quality ones. Sample level
effects were explored through dimensionality reduction methods and
segregated samples in PCA plots were removed from the datasets. Gene
level effects were evaluated with analyses of variance partition.

<b>3. Differential Expression Analysis (DEA)</b>: with the relevant
variables identified in the previous steps, the DEA was performed at the
gene level for nicotine and smoking exposure in adult and pup brain
samples, and for smoking exposure in adult blood samples; DEA at the
rest of the levels was performed for both exposures in pup brain only.
DE signals of the genes in the different conditions, ages, tissues, and
species (using human results from $^1$[Semick et al.,
2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-018-0223-1)) were
contrasted, as well as the DE signals of exons and transcripts vs those
of their genes. Mean expression of DEGs and non-DEGs genes with and
without DE features was also analyzed. Then, all resultant DEGs and DE
features (and their genes) were compared by direction of regulation (up
or down) between and within exposures (nicotine/smoking); mouse DEGs
were also compared against human genes associated with TUD from
$^2$[Toikumo et al.,
2023](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.27.23287713v2).

<b>4. Functional Enrichment Analysis</b>: GO & KEGG terms significantly
enriched in the clusters of DEGs and genes of DE transcripts and exons
were obtained.

<b>5. DGE visualization</b>: the log2-normalized expression of DEGs was
represented in heat maps in order to distinguish the groups of up- and
down-regulated genes.

<b>6. Novel junction gene annotation</b>: for uncharacterized DE
junctions with no annotated gene, their nearest, preceding, and
following genes were determined. </font>

## smoking Mouse datasets

The mouse datasets contain the following data in a single `R`
`RangedSummarizedExperiment`\* object for each feature (genes,
transcripts, exons, and exon-exon junctions):

- **Raw data**: raw read counts (for genes, exons, and junctions) or TPM
  (for transcripts), also including the original metadata of the
  expression features and samples.
- **Processed data**: normalized and log-scaled counts of the same
  features (log(CPM+0.5) for genes, exons, and junctions, or
  log(TPM+0.5) for transcripts). In addition to the feature and sample
  information, the datasets contain information of which ones were used
  in downstream analyses (the ones that passed filtering steps), and
  which features were differentially expressed in the different
  experiments.

Moreover, you can find human data generated in Semick et al., (2018) in
Mol Psychiatry (DOI: <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-018-0223-1>) that
contain the results of a DEA for cigarette smoke exposure in adult and
prenatal human brain.

\*For more details, check the documentation for
[`RangedSummarizedExperiment`](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/SummarizedExperiment/inst/doc/SummarizedExperiment.html)
objects.
